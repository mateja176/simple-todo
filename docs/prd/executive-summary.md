# Executive Summary

**Vision Alignment:**

This is a dual-purpose project. The user-facing product is an AI-coached todo application that prevents regret by helping users focus on tasks aligned with their goals. The strategic purpose is validating BMAD methodology - the most advanced spec-driven AI-assisted development framework - before applying it to high-stakes fintech projects.

**The User Product:** AI coaching that catches users before they waste time on wrong priorities. Works immediately as baseline todo app; AI coaching 100% optional. Target users are overwhelmed founders (Alex) and overwhelmed students (Jordan) suffering from "everything is urgent" paralysis.

**The Real Product:** BMAD methodology validation. Success = proving BMAD's standardized processes accelerate AI-integrated product development + documenting reusable patterns (latency optimization, coaching interaction design, anti-guilt UX). App can "fail" while methodology succeeds (fast pivots, quick hypothesis invalidation, proven patterns).

**Strategic Motivation:** Leverage BMAD's power and validate its standardized processes work in real-world constraints before committing to fintech projects with higher stakes.

**Validation Requirements:** While methodology learnings are primary goal, achieving genuine user adoption is necessary to fully validate BMAD. Shipping features without user traction = incomplete validation (doesn't test BMAD's ability to achieve PMF). Success requires both: (1) faster iteration than traditional approach AND (2) evidence users find value.

**BMAD Validation Metrics (Primary Success Criteria):**

- Iteration velocity: MVP shipped in <6 weeks vs traditional 3-6 months
- Pivot speed: Weekly iteration cycles based on feedback
- Pattern reusability: Latency/caching/coaching patterns documented for fintech transfer
- Documentation quality: Fintech team can replicate approach from artifacts
- Confidence gain: Team trusts BMAD for next high-stakes project

**Documentation Strategy:** Learnings documented publicly as BMAD case study for methodology credibility and future adoption.

**Critical Risk Mitigation:**

- **User Adoption Risk:** Pre-MVP validation mandatory (20 interviews + Wizard of Oz prototype). Track: 2-week retention >30%, coaching try rate >20%, time-to-first-value <45sec.
- **Cold Start Risk:** Quick goal capture (30-60sec), show example interactions, pre-generated coaching patterns for common scenarios.
- **Methodology Validation Risk:** Separate BMAD metrics from product metrics. Weekly retrospectives capture BMAD-specific learnings in real-time. Isolate what's being tested.
- **Latency Risk:** Technical spike validates <800ms achievable before MVP build. Design caching strategy + rule-based fallback.

## What Makes This Special

**User-Facing Differentiator:** Regret prevention over productivity optimization. The AI coach provides objective outside perspective to validate whether tasks align with bigger picture goals - catching wasted effort before months are lost. Unlike traditional todo apps that optimize execution, this prevents wrong work from happening.

**Strategic Differentiator:** Low-stakes learning laboratory for BMAD methodology. Testing AI cost/privacy trade-offs, latency optimization patterns, and spec-driven development velocity in safe environment before high-stakes fintech application.
