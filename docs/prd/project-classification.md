# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** web_app
**Domain:** general
**Complexity:** Domain = low (general productivity, no regulations) | Technical = medium (<800ms AI latency is hard constraint requiring caching, fallback, optimization patterns)

**Project Classification:**

Based on product brief signals (browser-based, responsive design, SPA characteristics, desktop + mobile support), this is classified as a **web application**. The domain is **general productivity** with low complexity - standard web app requirements without regulated industry concerns.

**Detection Rationale:**

- Brief specifies: "web-first," "responsive design," "desktop-optimized (Alex) + mobile-first (Jordan)"
- No specialized domain signals (healthcare, fintech, govtech, etc.)
- Standard CRUD operations + LLM API integration
- General software practices sufficient (no regulatory constraints)

**Domain Research Documents:** None
