# Success Criteria

**What Winning Looks Like:**

This project has dual success definitions - methodology validation AND user value delivery.

**Methodology Success (Primary):**

- **Iteration Velocity:** MVP shipped in <6 weeks (vs traditional 3-6 months)
- **Pattern Documentation:** Latency optimization, caching strategies, coaching interaction patterns documented and reusable for fintech
- **Pivot Capability:** Weekly iteration cycles based on user feedback demonstrate agility
- **Confidence Gain:** Team trusts BMAD for next high-stakes fintech project
- **Public Case Study:** Learnings documented publicly, establishing BMAD credibility

**User Value Success (Validation Requirement):**

- **Adoption Beyond Novelty:** 2-week retention >30% (users keep it past abandonment threshold)
- **AI Coaching Acceptance:** >20% try coaching in first session, >70% complete interaction (not abandoned mid-flow)
- **Time to Value:** <45 seconds from sign-up to first task created (immediate utility)
- **Behavioral Change:** Users report clearer prioritization, evidence of questioning tasks before completion
- **Aha Moments:** Users share stories of AI catching wasted effort ("saved me 3 days on wrong feature")

**Technical Success (Enabler):**

- **Response Latency:** <800ms AI coaching response (99th percentile) - flow not broken
- **Cost Sustainability:** LLM API costs manageable at 100 users × 50 interactions/day
- **Graceful Degradation:** App remains usable when LLM unavailable (rule-based fallback working)
- **No Support Fires:** NOT hearing "how do I disable AI?" or "too slow to use"

**What Failure Looks Like (Learn Fast):**

- Users sign up but don't return after 2 weeks (adoption problem)
- Coaching enabled then immediately disabled (friction problem)
- Time-to-first-value >45 seconds (cold start unsolved)
- Latency >800ms consistently (technical constraint unmet)
- Can't explain why something worked/failed (contaminated learnings)

**Success Hierarchy:**

1. **Must Have:** BMAD validation metrics achieved (iteration speed, documented patterns, confidence gained)
2. **Required for Complete Validation:** User adoption beyond novelty (proves BMAD can achieve PMF, not just ship features)
3. **Nice to Have:** Viral growth, significant revenue (out of scope for learning laboratory)
