# Product Brief: simple-todo

**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Author:** BMad
**Context:** Personal/Learning Project

---

## Executive Summary

**The Real Product: BMAD Methodology Validation**

An AI-coached todo application serving as a low-stakes learning laboratory to validate BMAD methodology before high-stakes fintech projects. The todo app is the vehicle, not the destination.

**User-Facing Product:** AI coaching that prevents regret by helping users focus on tasks aligned with their goals. Works immediately as baseline todo app; AI coaching 100% optional. "Stop wasting time on the wrong stuff."

**Strategic Purpose:** Prove BMAD accelerates AI product development, document what transfers to fintech, build reusable patterns (latency optimization, coaching interaction design, anti-guilt UX), establish confidence in methodology under real constraints.

**Success Measured By:** Methodology learnings + documented patterns, not just app adoption. App can "fail" while methodology succeeds (e.g., fast pivots, quick hypothesis invalidation, proven AI integration patterns).

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

People suffer from "everything is urgent" paralysis, leading to months or years spent on wrong priorities. Traditional todo apps optimize for task completion (efficiency) rather than ensuring the right tasks get done (effectiveness). Users experience:

- Tunnel vision and miscalibrated capabilities when self-assessing priorities
- Cognitive overload from apps that add guilt rather than clarity
- High opportunity cost from completing tasks that don't advance stated goals
- Regret from straying off their intended path due to poor prioritization

### Problem Impact

- Users abandon productivity systems within 2 weeks due to cognitive load
- Wrong tasks actively move people away from their goals (opportunity cost)
- "Wasted effort" - tasks completed that provide no advancement toward what matters
- Decision paralysis when facing competing urgent priorities (e.g., investor deck vs customer bug)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Traditional todo apps focus on:
- Task organization and sorting rather than task validation
- Adding features (tags, filters, reminders) that increase cognitive load
- Nagging notifications that create guilt instead of clarity
- Execution optimization without questioning if tasks are worth doing

### Proposed Solution

An AI coach that provides objective outside perspective to help users:
- Validate whether tasks align with their bigger picture goals
- Break decision paralysis through quick goal-alignment checks
- Prevent regret before wasting months on wrong priorities
- Maintain clarity through anti-guilt design principles

**Immediate value baseline:** Works as excellent todo app without any AI interaction

**Optional AI coaching:** Users opt-in when they want guidance, opt-out anytime

**Core mechanism:** Quick one-time goal capture (3-5 min) enables AI to reference user's top life goals in coaching interactions, solving cold-start problem without passive learning complexity.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Regret prevention over productivity** - Focus on preventing wasted effort, not optimizing completion
2. **Works immediately, AI optional** - Baseline todo app provides instant value; coaching is enhancement not requirement
3. **5-second value proposition** - "Stop wasting time on the wrong stuff" (concrete examples shown immediately)
4. **Sub-second AI responses** - Aggressive caching and pre-generated patterns ensure flow isn't broken
5. **Learning laboratory** - Low-stakes validation of BMAD methodology for future fintech applications

## Target Users

**VALIDATION REQUIRED:** Overwhelmed people won't invest in setup. Early adopters (productivity tool enthusiasts) ≠ target users (people in genuine crisis).

### Primary Persona #1: Alex, The Overwhelmed Founder

**Profile:**
- Solo/small team startup builders
- 50+ competing priorities, decision paralysis daily
- 6 months into startup, working 80hrs/week but not moving forward

**Core Pain:** "I'm working on the wrong things and won't realize until it's too late"
- Fear: Wasting months on wrong direction, business failure
- Struggle: Can't tell what actually matters vs what feels urgent
- Need: Objective "co-founder substitute" to question reasoning

**Context:**
- Desktop-first workflow (working at computer)
- Business goals: "raise funding," "ship MVP," "retain customers"
- Willing to pay moderate amount for value
- Opportunity cost measured in weeks/months

**What Alex Thinks:**
- "I'm good at execution but terrible at prioritization"
- "Another todo app won't fix my real problem"
- "Maybe I need a co-founder to question my decisions"
- "What if I'm wasting months on the wrong things?"

**What Alex Feels:**
- Morning: 😰 Overwhelmed by todo list
- During work: 🤨 "Is this actually important or am I avoiding hard stuff?"
- Choosing tasks: 🫨 Paralyzed between competing urgencies
- Evening: 😞 "Worked all day on the wrong things"

**What Alex Values Most:**
- Objective outside perspective (co-founder questioning)
- Fast clarity (2-min decision support, not 2-hour analysis)
- Wasted effort prevention (catch bad priorities early)
- Confidence in decisions (sleep knowing made right call)

---

### Primary Persona #2: Jordan, The Overwhelmed Student

**Profile:**
- College students (junior/senior) juggling classes + work + activities + career prep
- Everything feels urgent, nothing feels important
- Constant "should I be doing something else?" anxiety

**Core Pain:** "I'm busy all the time but am I doing college 'right'?"
- Fear: Wasting college years, making bad resume choices, disappointing everyone
- Struggle: Conflicting advice from all directions (parents/professors/peers/career center)
- Need: Permission to say no + future-value clarity

**Context:**
- Mobile-first (between classes, always on phone)
- Academic + career goals: "good grades," "get job," "build skills"
- Cannot pay (free tier essential)
- FOMO + social pressure + deadline tyranny

**What Jordan Thinks:**
- "Everyone else seems to have it together"
- "Should I focus on grades, resume building, or actually learning?"
- "I say yes to everything because I don't know what matters"
- "Am I spending time on stuff that won't help me get a job?"

**What Jordan Feels:**
- Morning: 😰 Dread at packed schedule
- During class: 😶 "This feels irrelevant to my goals"
- Late night: 😫 "Spent 6 hours on low-value assignment"
- Comparing to peers: 😔 "They seem to know what they're doing"

**What Jordan Values Most:**
- Permission to say no (FOMO cure, guilt-free choices)
- Future-value filter ("Will this matter in 5 years?")
- Fast decisions (2 min between classes)
- Guilt reduction (validation that can't do everything)
- Sustainable pace (not burning out every finals week)

---

### Shared Core Pain: Decision Paralysis from "Everything Is Urgent"

**Both Experience:**
- Everything-feels-urgent freeze-up daily
- Wasted effort regret ("why did I spend time on that?")
- Lack of objective perspective (no one to question choices)
- Imposter syndrome ("others seem to have it figured out")
- Tool abandonment cycles (2 weeks then stop using)
- Guilt loops (didn't finish X, can't focus on Y)

**Critical Insight: Not Productivity Problem, It's Confidence Problem**
- They don't need help executing tasks
- They need help knowing WHICH tasks to do
- Traditional todo apps solve wrong problem (organization vs validation)

**Both Need:**
- Objective outside perspective to question reasoning
- Fast clarity (2-min decision support, not analysis paralysis)
- Wasted effort prevention (catch priority mismatches early)
- Anti-guilt design (reduce shame, increase confidence)
- Sustainable pace (not burnout cycles)

---

### Design Implications for Both Personas

**Shared Requirements:**
- Works immediately as baseline todo app (both have no time for setup)
- AI coaching 100% optional (both are skeptical)
- <800ms response time (both need flow unbroken)
- Anti-guilt design (both struggle with productivity shame)
- Fast decision support (both need quick clarity)

**Jordan-Specific Adaptations:**
- **Free tier essential** (no money for paid tools)
- **Mobile-first design** (between classes, on-the-go)
- **Quick interactions** (30-sec coaching, not deep sessions)
- **Future-value framing** ("Will this matter in 5 years?")
- **Permission language** ("It's okay to skip this, here's why")
- **Simple goal capture** ("Get good job" is sufficient)

**Alex-Specific Adaptations:**
- **Business context** (goals like "raise funding," "ship MVP")
- **Desktop-optimized** (working at computer)
- **Deeper interactions okay** (5-min coaching acceptable)
- **Opportunity cost framing** ("This costs 3 days you can't get back")
- **Co-founder language** ("Let me question that assumption")
- **Strategic goals** (specific business/life objectives)

---

### Pre-MVP Validation Required

**Must Interview 20 Target Users (10 Alex, 10 Jordan):**
- Do they want AI coaching for priorities (not just organization)?
- Socratic questioning vs directive suggestions preference?
- "Objective co-founder" (Alex) vs "permission to say no" (Jordan) - which resonates?
- Will they invest 30 seconds for goal capture even when overwhelmed?
- What's minimum aha moment frequency to justify continued usage?

**Wizard of Oz Prototype Testing:**
- Manual AI coaching (you play the AI) with 5 users each persona
- Test tone, question style, response speed expectations
- Measure: Does coaching help or add friction?

**Kill Criterion:**
- If <60% positive on AI coaching concept → pivot approach
- If Alex and Jordan need fundamentally different products → pick one persona
- If neither persona has willingness to try even free version → wrong target

## Technical Preferences

**Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript
- Database: TBD (PostgreSQL or MongoDB likely)
- Frontend: TBD (simple framework for MVP)
- AI Integration: LLM API (OpenAI/Anthropic)

**Architecture Principles:**
- Keep MVP simple and nimble
- Stack-agnostic BMAD methodology (learnings transfer to Python fintech projects)
- Design for eventual API resilience but tolerate single point of failure in MVP
- Opt for development speed over premature optimization

**Key Technical Considerations:**
- **CRITICAL:** <800ms AI response time (hard requirement - latency kills flow)
- Aggressive caching strategy for common coaching patterns
- Pre-generated coaching questions loaded at startup
- Rule-based fallback when LLM slow/unavailable
- LLM API cost management during user acquisition phase
- Data privacy for personal todo items
- Database schema for coaching conversation history

**Pre-Launch Technical Validation:**
- Load testing with simulated 1000 users × 50 interactions/day
- Cost modeling before scaling
- Circuit breakers for API rate limits tested
- Graceful degradation documented and working

---

## Organizational Context

**Strategic Alignment: The Real Product Is Methodology Validation**

This todo app is a **vehicle for learning**, not the destination. Success = methodology insights + reusable patterns, NOT app adoption alone.

**Primary Goals (BMAD Methodology Validation):**
1. Prove BMAD accelerates AI-integrated product development vs traditional approach
2. Document what transfers to fintech domain vs what's todo-app-specific
3. Build reusable patterns: latency optimization, coaching interaction design, anti-guilt UX
4. Establish confidence in methodology before high-stakes fintech projects
5. Test resource-constrained solo development approach

**Secondary Goals (Product Learning):**
- Validate AI coaching interactions effectiveness (Socratic vs directive)
- Measure real LLM API costs at scale (100-1000 users)
- Test AI cost/privacy trade-offs in low-risk environment
- Understand user tolerance for AI coaching in productivity tools

**Success Can Look Like "Failure":**
- App gets no traction BUT BMAD enabled fast pivot identification
- Users reject AI coaching BUT methodology proved hypothesis quickly
- Technical issues emerge BUT resilience patterns documented
- App shuts down BUT learnings transfer perfectly to fintech

**Isolated Success Metrics (BMAD vs Product):**

**BMAD Methodology Metrics:**
- Development velocity: MVP shipped in <6 weeks?
- Pivot speed: Can we iterate weekly based on feedback?
- Pattern reusability: Do latency/caching solutions transfer to fintech?
- Documentation quality: Can fintech team replicate approach?
- Confidence gain: Do we trust methodology for next project?

**Product-Market Fit Metrics (Separate):**
- User retention beyond 2 weeks
- Coach Mode adoption rate
- User-reported value

**Cross-Pollination Opportunities:**
- Decision-making coaching patterns → financial decision coaching
- Latency optimization techniques → real-time fintech UX
- Anti-guilt design → financial wellness products
- "Regret prevention" framing → investment decision support

## Risks and Assumptions

### Top 3 Critical Risks (From Pre-mortem Analysis)

**🚨 RISK #1: AI Coaching Adds Friction Instead Of Reducing It**
- **Failure mode:** Latency breaks flow, Socratic questions feel condescending
- **Warning signs:** Time-to-first-value >45min, support asks "how to disable AI", Coach Mode <20% adoption
- **Prevention:**
  - <800ms response time (hard requirement)
  - Mix directive + Socratic (test preference)
  - Everything optional, zero mandatory fields
  - Aggressive caching + rule-based fallback

**🚨 RISK #2: Value Unclear Until After Significant Investment**
- **Failure mode:** Can't demonstrate benefit in first session, cold-start problem
- **Warning signs:** First 10 beta users need extensive onboarding calls
- **Prevention:**
  - Works as excellent baseline todo app immediately
  - Quick goal capture (3-5min) solves cold-start
  - Show concrete example on landing (<5 sec value prop)
  - "Stop wasting time on wrong stuff" not abstract "regret prevention"

**🚨 RISK #3: Wrong Target Users (Overwhelmed People Won't Invest)**
- **Failure mode:** People needing help most have least bandwidth, early adopters ≠ crisis users
- **Warning signs:** Productivity enthusiasts signing up vs actual overwhelmed founders
- **Prevention:**
  - Pre-MVP validation: 20 target user interviews
  - Wizard of Oz prototype testing
  - 5-second setup requirement
  - Kill criterion: <60% positive → pivot

### Additional Risks

- LLM API costs may become prohibitive at scale
- Rate limits may hit during peak usage
- "Regret prevention" hypothesis may not resonate
- Two-mode system confusion (REMOVED from MVP)
- Importance + Confidence scoring adds friction (MADE OPTIONAL)
- BMAD learnings contaminated by too many variables

### Critical Assumptions TO VALIDATE

**MUST TEST before MVP:**
- ❓ Users want objective outside perspective on priorities
- ❓ Socratic questioning vs directive advice preference (TEST BOTH)
- ❓ People tolerate opt-in AI coaching in todo app
- ✓ Node.js/TypeScript learnings transfer to fintech Python projects
- ✓ Growth stage can tolerate OpEx losses during acquisition

**Validation Plan:**
- 20 target user interviews about AI coaching concept
- Low-fidelity prototype (manual Wizard of Oz AI)
- Measure coaching style preference and tolerance
- Kill criterion: <60% positive response → pivot approach

---
